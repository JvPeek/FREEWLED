# FREEWLED
The forever free version of WLED ðŸ–•
Since the WLED team decided to sell the project to Googel, removing Alexa, Hue, MQTT, Home Assistant, DMX, E1.31 and ArtNet in the process, i decided to fork WLED to keep it free forever.
I haven't even read the darn post until the end. That's how MAD i am. And you should be too.

## Let's see how far they'll get without the community.
Since i don't want to keep the code on GitHub in fear of DMCA takedowns i have decided to move the codebase to my own Gitea server.
I have recorded a quick statement video explaining the matter further. There you'll learn how to access the code in the future.

The video statement is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
